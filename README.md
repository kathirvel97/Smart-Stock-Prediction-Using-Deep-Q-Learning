# This project leverages Q-Learning, a reinforcement learning technique, to develop a stock trading agent capable of making decisions in a highly dynamic and volatile market environment. By training on historical stock price data, the agent learns to select from three possible actions—Buy, Sell, or Hold—to maximize cumulative rewards. Our approach integrates market simulation and dynamic decision-making to capture the complexities of real-world trading. The results indicate that Q-Learning can effectively model stock trading decisions, offering a promising method for enhancing financial decision-making processes.
